Hi %firstname%,

Thanks for reaching out to us about your order! To answer your question, section 4302 of Title 30 of the Delaware Code imposes a 1.92 percent (0.0192) use tax on leases of tangible personal property where such property is used within Delaware. This essentially means that if you rent a physical item, and have it shipped to address within Delaware, then tax is applied based on the goods and address.  This is due to internet rental companies, with physical store fronts in California, having nexus in the state under the use tax laws.  If you’re interested in reading further about the rules and regulations governing tax laws for Delaware then, please see the following link: “https://revenue.delaware.gov/services/current_bt/taxtips/lessors.pdf”. I hope this helps to clarify how tax is calculated in your state.  If I can help you with anything else, just shout! 

Cheers,
