    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

I received word from my team that you’re concerned about a potential breach with the card used on your order. I wanted to personally reach out to you so I can investigate the matter further. Here’s the chain of events as I understand them:
 
 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 
 
I’d love to get a few more details from you:

• At what time and date did this unauthorized charge go through?
• Where was this charge made?
• Where did you place this order? What type of network were you on? Location?
• Where were the images uploaded from? What type of network were you on? Location?
• Have you run into this type of issue before or since?
 
I haven’t received any other complaints of a breach. By looking at the view log on your order, I can tell that it’s highly unlikely to be an internal breach. Hopefully, with a little more information we can get a better idea of what happened. Please email me back at your earliest convenience. Or, you can call me directly Monday through Friday between [WORK HOURS] PST. Just call 1-844-853-6737 and ask to speak to [NAME]. 
 
I eats me up to hear that your card was used in an unauthorized transaction! We see unauthorized use all too often, and it’s something we work very hard to combat. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
