    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
Thanks for your interest in renting with us! Unfortunately, we’ve had to cancel this order because we don’t accept prepaid debit or credit cards, or gift credit cards for payment. To move forward with your order, we’ll need a major credit or debit card on file, such as a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express. For a more information, take a look at our Help page under the &quot;Billing&quot; section. (borrowlenses.com/content/billing) Please get in touch if you have any questions – I’m happy to help!

Best,
 
{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
