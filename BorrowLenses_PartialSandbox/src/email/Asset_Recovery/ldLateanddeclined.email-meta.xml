Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

I’m writing to let you know that your order is considerably late, and your credit card was declined for any amount. 
 
It’s our policy that orders must be paid in full before you can extend the rental period beyond the original due date. We also expect renters to keep us informed of the most accurate return date because if we don’t know when our equipment is coming back, we can’t meet other orders. 
 
Please contact us ASAP with enough funds on your card to cover the back fees and additional days you need. If we decide to charge late fees, please note this will be considerably more expensive than the extension price, which we typically grant before the original rental period ends.

 Regards,

 {!Case.OwnerFirstName}
