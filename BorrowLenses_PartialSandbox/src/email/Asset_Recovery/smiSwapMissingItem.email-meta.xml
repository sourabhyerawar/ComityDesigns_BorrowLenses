    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 
 
It appears you’ve shipped us your [MISSING ITEM]. Can you please check if the [MISSING ITEM] in your possession has a Borrowlenses barcode on it?
 
If so, we can handle it 2 ways:

1. We can ship each item back to its original owner. Return shipping costs are $8-$10.
2. We can swap items, so you keep ours and we keep yours. Includes a $5 (not including tax) re-barcoding fee.

If you’d like to swap, please confirm your card on file is OK to charge the re-barcoding fee. Then, please remove the barcode on your item to prevent any mix-ups in the future.
 
If you’d like us to ship back your gear, please confirm your card on file is OK to charge for shipping (approx $8-$10) and let us know your return address and whether you’d like a signature required for delivery. Then, send back our missing item and email us the tracking number.

Here are our return addresses:
 
BorrowLenses.com
 &quot;MISSING ITEMS&quot; Order #
 1664 Industrial Road
 San Carlos, Ca 94070
 
 or
 
 BorrowLenses.com
 &quot;MISSING ITEMS&quot; Order #
 411 Waverly Oaks Rd.
 STE #113
 Waltham, MA 02452

Please let me know which option you’d like to move forward with, or if you have any other questions.
 
 Thanks,
