Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
It's no trouble at all! I’ll gladly make those changes for you. I’ve gone ahead and swapped the discount codes and sent you a new invoice that details the changes to your order. Please give the invoice a once-over to make sure everything is as it should be.

If there’s anything else I can do to help, please let me know!

Have a good one,
