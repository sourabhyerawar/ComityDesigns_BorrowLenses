Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
I’m reaching out about your order [XXXXXX]. I wanted to let you know it will be available for pick up after 12PM on XX-XX, due to items being transferred from our Boston warehouse. You’ll get a confirmation email once the rental is ready to be picked up.

Please email me back if you have any questions!
 
Best,
 
 {!Case.OwnerFirstName}
