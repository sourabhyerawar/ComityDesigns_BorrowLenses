    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

I noticed in your order notes that you would prefer your equipment to arrive before ____.  We may be able to upgrade your shipping to an AM delivery, Depending on your zip code items generally arrive by 10:30am, but it can rarely be as late as noon.  The cost for this service is an additional $20 per box.  Otherwise, the shipment may arrive at any time during business hours, occasionally up-to, or later than 7pm.  To do this we MUST hear back from you by 1:00 PM PST (4:00 EST) Please let me know if you would like to upgrade your shipping method.  If we don&apos;t hear back from you we will ship for standard delivery.

Thank you,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
