Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

I’m sorry but an extension isn’t possible at the moment because all the [XXXX] in our inventory are booked for your requested times. A later shipment may mean that our next customer won’t get the item they reserved. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for understanding.
 
If you have any questions, or if there’s anything else I can do to help, please let me know!
 
 Thanks,
 
 {!Case.OwnerFirstName}
