Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
Thanks for letting us know your rental will return later than expected. To help you avoid expensive late fees, I have extended your order through today’s date which brings your account to a current status. I’ve also sent you an email confirming these changes.

Please let me know if there’s anything else I can for you!
 
Best,
