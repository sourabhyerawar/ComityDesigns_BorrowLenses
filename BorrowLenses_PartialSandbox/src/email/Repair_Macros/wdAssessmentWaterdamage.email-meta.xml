    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
  
I’m reaching out about your recent order #XXXXX. We’ve completed the repairs and calculated the final amount owed. The item was damaged by water or moisture, which isn’t covered under our GearGuard policy. 
  
Here’s a summary of the repair cost:
  
Item: XXXX
Cost of repair: $XXXX + tax
  
Please email me back so I can charge this amount and close the case on your account. I can charge the card on file or, if you’d prefer, you can call me with a different method of payment. Please note that if we don’t hear back from you within 5 days, your account information may be sent to collections.  
  
For more information about damage and GearGuard, please refer to that section on our help page (borrowlenses.com/content/damage_waiver), or review the Equipment Lease Agreement (borrowlenses.com/content/rental_agreement).
  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kindly,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
