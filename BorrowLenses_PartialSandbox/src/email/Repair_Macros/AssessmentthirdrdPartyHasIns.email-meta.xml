    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
  
I’m reaching out about your recent order #XXXXX. We’ve completed the repairs and calculated the final amount owed.
  
Since you purchased GearGuard, you’re only liable for 12% of the item’s replacement value, or the repair fees, whichever is cheaper.
  
Here’s a summary of the repair cost and 12% replacement value referenced from www.bhphotovideo.com:
  
 Item: XXXX
 Cost of repair: $XXXX
 12% replacement value: $XXXX
  
The cheaper of the two costs and the amount owed to close this case is: $XXXX + tax. 
 
Please email me back so I can charge this amount and close the case on your account. I can charge your card on file or, if you’d prefer, you can call me with a different method of payment. Please note that if we don’t hear back from you within 5 days, your account information may be sent to collections.  
  
For more information about damage and GearGuard, please refer to that section on our help page (borrowlenses.com/content/damage_waiver) or review the Equipment Lease Agreement (borrowlenses.com/content/rental_agreement). 
  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kindly,
