    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
  
I’m reaching out about your recent order #XXXXX. We’ve completed the repairs and calculated the final amount owed.

Here’s a summary of the repair cost:
  
Item: XXXX
  
Replacement parts cost: $XXXXX
Labor cost: $XXXXX
Total repair cost: $XXXXX
  
Since you didn’t purchase GearGuard, you’ll also need to pay a “loss of use” fee, which is the rental rate for the time the item was out for repair. The item was out for XX days, which equals $XXXX in loss of use fees. Please know that we use the fastest service possible to limit the amount of time the gear is out for repair.
  
Here’s a summary of the total amount owed:
  
Repair fee: $XXX
Loss of use fee: $XXX
  
Total: $XXX + tax
 
Please email me back so I can charge this amount and close the case on your account. I can charge the card on file or, if you’d prefer, you can call me with a different method of payment. Please note that if we don’t hear back from you within 5 days, your account information may be sent to collections.  
  
For more information about damage and GearGuard, please refer to that section on our help page (borrowlenses.com/content/damage_waiver), or review the Equipment Lease Agreement (borrowlenses.com/content/rental_agreement). 
  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kindly,
