    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

Please email me back as soon as you can, so I can charge the amount owed and close the case on your account. I can charge the card on file, or if you’d prefer, you can call me with a different method of payment. Please note that if we don’t hear back from you within 5 days your account information may be sent to collections.  
  
For more information about damage and GearGuard, please refer to that section on our help page (borrowlenses.com/content/damage_waiver), or review the Equipment Lease Agreement here: www.borrowlenses.com/content/rental_agreement.  

Kindly,
