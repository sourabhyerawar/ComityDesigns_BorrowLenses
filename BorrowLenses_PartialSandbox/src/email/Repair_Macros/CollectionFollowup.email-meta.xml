    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
  
I’m writing because we haven’t heard back from you after my previous email. 

Please email me back as soon as you can, so I can charge the amount and close the case on your account. I can charge your card on file or, if you’d prefer, you can call me with a different method of payment. Please note that if we don’t hear back from you within 5 days, your account information may be sent to collections.  
  
For more information about damage and GearGuard, please refer to that section on our help page (borrowlenses.com/content/damage_waiver), or review the Equipment Lease Agreement (borrowlenses.com/content/rental_agreement). 
  
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kindly,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
