Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

Your order may require extra verification, which could be extra documentation, third party insurance, or a deposit. Our verifications team reviews all orders and decides if any of these options is necessary. After reviewing the order, they'll send you an email with all of the information and documents that they require. If you have any questions about this process, definitely reach out to our verifications team at verify@borrowlenses.com or dial our number and press ext. 4. 

Regards,
