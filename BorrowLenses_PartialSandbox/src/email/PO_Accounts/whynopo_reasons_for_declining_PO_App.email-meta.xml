    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I understand this news can be disappointing – please let me explain.

After evaluating your application, our accounting department determined that we’re unable to allow [XXX ] to order on credit. Payment by invoicing is reserved for very large rental orders, and is further based on a number of factors, including business size and years in existence. Ultimately, the decision lies with our insurance underwriters. Unfortunately, I can’t offer any more details since I can’t see exactly what went into the underwriters’ decision.

I’d still like to accommodate your rental request, so please let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help!

Kindly,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
