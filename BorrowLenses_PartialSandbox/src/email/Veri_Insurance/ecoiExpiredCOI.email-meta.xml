    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
It appears that the certificate of insurance we have on file expired on XXXXXX INSERT DATE XXXXXXXXXX. Could you please provide us with an updated certificate before your order ships out? 

We’ll need to be listed as &quot;Additionally Insured” and &quot;Loss Payee&quot; on the certificate of insurance. The certificate needs to provide coverage for the replacement cost of the equipment, which is $XXXXXX on this order. The name and address should read as follows:
 
 Shutterfly, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary BorrowLenses, LLC. 
 1664 Industrial Rd
 San Carlos, CA 94070
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions. 
 
 Best,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
