    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
Earlier, we sent you an email requesting verification documents. I wanted to let you know that weâ€™ve gone ahead and waived verification for this particular order, so you can disregard that email. However, feel free to upload the documents to your account at your convenience, as they may be required for future orders. 

Regards,
