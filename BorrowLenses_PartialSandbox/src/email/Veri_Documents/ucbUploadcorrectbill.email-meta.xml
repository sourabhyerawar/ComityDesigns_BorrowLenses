    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

Thanks for sending us your verification documents! However, it appears weâ€™re still missing an official document that associates your name with the billing address (XXXXXXX INSERT BILLING ADDRESS XXXXXXX). This could be any document that officially lists your billing address, like a utility bill, phone bill, bank statement, lease agreement or car registration. Please upload this document ASAP to make sure your order ships on time.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing back from you soon!

 
Best,

{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
