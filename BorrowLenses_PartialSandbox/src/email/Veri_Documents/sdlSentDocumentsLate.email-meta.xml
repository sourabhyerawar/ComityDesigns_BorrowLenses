    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
Thanks for sending your verification documents. Unfortunately, they were sent too late for yesterday&apos;s shipment, so we were unable to get your order out on time. If we keep this order on Standard Shipping, you’ll receive it on XX/XX/XX. The other option is to have it shipped overnight so you get it on your original requested delivery date, XX/XX/XX. However, you would be responsible for the overnight shipping costs. 

Please let me know how you’d like to move forward.
 
 Best,
 
{!Case.OwnerFirstName}
