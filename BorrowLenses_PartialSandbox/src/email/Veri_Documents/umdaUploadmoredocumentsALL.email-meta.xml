    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  
 
We’re still missing the following 2 verification documents:
 
 1) A clear photograph or scan of your driver’s license (NOTE: we can’t accept passport, passport cards, military ID cards or school ID cards.)
 
 AND
 
 2) A clear copy of your utility bill, phone bill, car registration or any other document that clearly lists your name and billing address (XXXXXXXX INSERT BILLING ADDRESS XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).
 
Please upload these images to your account as soon as possible to make sure your order ships on time. Thanks in advance for your cooperation!
 
 Best,
