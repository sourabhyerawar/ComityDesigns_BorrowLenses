Hi {!Contact.FirstName},  

That's a great question! If you're interested in learning about our policy, how we test equipment, our rating system, 12 settings we recommend checking when your gear arrives, and much more, then check out our blog: "https://www.borrowlenses.com/blog/camera-and-lens-quality-borrowlenses-used-gear-rentals/"! There are a lot of great details to get you started. Of course, if you have any questions for me, I'm here to help, so ask away!

Regards,
